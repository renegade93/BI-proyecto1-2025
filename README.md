# Text Analytics Project for UN Population Fund (UNFPA)

## Project Overview

Build text analytics models to automatically classify citizen opinions with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 4:
- SDG 1: End of Poverty
- SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
- SDG 4: Quality Education

## Etapa 1 - Step-by-Step Tasks (Due: September 13, 2025, 8:00 PM)

### Preliminary Steps
1. Form group of 2-3 students
2. Register group in BloqueNeón
3. Read entire project document

### Section 1 (20%): Machine Learning Process Documentation
4. Complete Machine Learning Canvas with all 9 sections:
   - Learning Task
   - Decisions
   - Value Proposition
   - Data Sources
   - Impact Simulation
   - Learning (Model Usage)
   - Model Construction
   - Feature Engineering
   - (Skip: Data Collection and Monitoring sections)

### Section 2 (20%): Data Understanding and Preparation
5. Perform data profiling and quality analysis
6. Implement data preprocessing and transformations
7. Prepare data according to domain requirements and selected algorithms

### Section 3 (20%): Modeling and Evaluation
8. Implement first algorithm (assign to student 1)
9. Implement second algorithm (assign to student 2)
10. Implement third algorithm (assign to student 3, or additional algorithm if 2-person team)
11. Document each algorithm's description and implementation
12. Calculate evaluation metrics for all models
13. Compare models and justify final selection
14. Include student names for each algorithm worked on

### Section 4 (20%): Results
15. Analyze quality metrics and business impact
16. Perform word analysis for ODS classification
17. Develop organizational strategies based on results
18. Create Excel file with test data and model predictions
19. Record 5-minute explanatory video for wiki

### Section 5 (8%): Teamwork Documentation
20. Document roles and tasks per team member
21. Record time spent (hours) per person per task
22. Document algorithm assignments per student
23. Document project challenges and solutions
24. Document ChatGPT usage
25. Distribute 100 points among team members
26. Identify improvement points for Stage 2

### Additional Deliverables
27. Prepare for individual assessment/defense (12%)
28. Create GitHub repository with wiki
29. Upload processed dataset to repository
30. Ensure all code is referenced in deliverables

### Submission Requirements
31. Submit wiki URL through BloqueNeón
32. Ensure document is max 10 pages (Arial 12, single column)
33. Submit by September 13, 2025, 8:00 PM

## Key Project Guidelines

- **Team Formation**: 2-3 students, can be from different sections
- **Documentation**: Justify every decision in each phase
- **Business Focus**: Connect technical results to organizational needs
- **Repository**: Create comprehensive wiki with all deliverables and code references
- **Bonus Opportunity**: Top 5 groups by model performance get 0.3/5.0 bonus points

## Success Criteria

- Models should classify citizen opinions into SDGs 1, 3, and 4
- Analysis must identify key words linking opinions to specific SDGs
- Solution should be business-relevant and technically sound
- Complete documentation with justified decisions throughout
