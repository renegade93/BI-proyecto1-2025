⏺ Etapa 1 Summary - Text Analytics Project for UN Population Fund (UNFPA)

  Project Overview

  Build text analytics models to automatically classify citizen opinions with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 4:
  - SDG 1: End of Poverty
  - SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
  - SDG 4: Quality Education

  Etapa 1 Requirements (Due: September 13, 8:00 PM)

  Objective: Apply text analytics methodology to build analytical solutions aligned with organizational objectives.

  Deliverables Breakdown:

# Machine Learning Canvas (20%)

  Complete the provided ML Canvas template covering:
  - Learning task definition
  - Decision processes
  - Value proposition
  - Data sources
  - Feature engineering
  - Model construction
  - Impact simulation

 # Data Understanding & Preparation (20%)

  - Data profiling and quality analysis
  - Data treatment/transformations required
  - Justify preprocessing choices based on domain, techniques, and algorithms

 # Modeling & Evaluation (20%)

  - Apply minimum 3 different algorithms
  - Each team member must implement at least one algorithm
  - Describe algorithms and justify model selection with evaluation metrics
  - Include team member names for each model

# Results Analysis (20%)

  a) Business Impact Analysis: Explain how model metrics contribute to business objectives
  b) Word Analysis: Analyze key words that relate opinions to SDGs and propose organizational strategiesc) Test Data Predictions: Deliver Excel file with predictions from selected model
  (used for F1-score comparison between groups)
  d) 5-minute Video: Explain project and results

# Teamwork Documentation (8%)

  - Role descriptions and time allocation (hours) per member
  - Algorithm assignments and challenges faced
  - ChatGPT usage documentation
  - Distribute 100 points among team members
  - Identify improvement areas

# Additional Deliverables:

  - Individual Contribution Evaluation (12%)
  - Prepared Dataset (required for oral defense)
  - GitHub Repository with wiki containing all deliverables

  Key Tips:

  1. Team Formation: 2-3 students, can be from different sections
  2. Register in BloqueNeón to enable submission link
  3. Justify Every Decision in each phase
  4. Focus on Business Value: Connect technical results to organizational needs
  5. Repository Structure: Create comprehensive wiki with all deliverables and code references
  6. Bonus Opportunity: Top 5 groups by model performance get 0.3/5.0 bonus points

  Success Criteria:

  - Models should classify citizen opinions into SDGs 1, 3, and 4
  - Analysis must identify key words linking opinions to specific SDGs
  - Solution should be business-relevant and technically sound
  - Complete documentation with justified decisions throughout
